## introduction
We are selecting educational related topics as our group project. We have decided to work on our project on “online book store”. We will create a web application for online book store. A software project for an online bookstore that serves as a central database for all of the books in stock, as well as their title, author, and price.

## objectives
The aim of this project is to create a website that serves as a central book store. Our web application customers will be able to purchase any book and book related information. 

## Features and functionalities
The front end of this website is built with HTML, CSS, and the back end is built with PHP. The SQL database stores a variety of book-related data. A user can find a various selection of books organised by category on the website. The user can select a book and view the price. The website can also be used to search for unique books. After selecting a book, the user must complete a form before the book can be booked for him.
